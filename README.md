# Computer Vision Project 

This is the repo for our CV project.

## Trello Board

With [this link](https://trello.com/invite/b/B6VGnxzG/1d087491803e63ed6d702d956e233a1a/computer-vision-project) you can go to our trello board. Please read the "Usage" section below before you proceed. 

## Usage

For now, there's 4 lists:
- Ideas
- Segmentation
- Tracking
- Remove doubles/False positives

The "Ideas" list contains methods that nobody has looked at in detail yet. You can add methods to it anytime regardless. If you decide to investigate a method further, especially concerning testing for feasibility in MATLAB, then move an idea into the respective other list and add yourself as a member of that card. Multiple people can work on the same idea, but it's advised that everybody works on different stuff.

> If you know the topic of a method, please add a description outlining the steps taken. This will help creating the presentation.
